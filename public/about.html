<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a former pilot and combat veteran with multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, where my life became deeply rooted in service. 
Having seen firsthand how injuries can affect lives—whether from overseas deployments, within our communities, 
or in our own families—I've channeled that understanding into a new mission. As an aspiring software developer and driven entrepreneur, 
I founded A Better Solution In Home Care to reinvent how home care should be provided. My vision is to blend cutting-edge technology with 
compassionate care, creating a service that not only supports seniors but transforms their daily lives by making care more accessible, 
efficient, and personalized.</p>

<p>At A Better Solution In Home Care, I'm committed to leading with dependability and earning your trust by delivering assistance 
that simplifies life's challenges. Trust and respect are the foundation of who I am and how I serve, shaping every decision and interaction. 
Through this company, I aim to set a new standard for home care—one that honors the dignity of those we serve while leveraging innovation to 
meet their evolving needs.</p>

<p>I hail from the Bronx, NY, and since 2014, my wife, Alisa, and I have built a life together, raising our four wonderful children in Raleigh,
where we've called home since 2018. We're inspired by North Carolina's vibrant people, rich culture, and welcoming diversity, and I'm thrilled 
to bring A Better Solution In Home Care to this growing community as a testament to my commitment to service and progress.</p>
